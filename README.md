### Why is it called "RE:Minecraft"?
It's a spin on the anime "RE:Zero"

## Whaaaa
Basically, it'll keep you logged in even when you disconnect your Minecraft client. It'll also have a useful events system and plugin loader, with an API, obviously. This is still a WIP. More documentation will be added when it actually does something. :heart:
