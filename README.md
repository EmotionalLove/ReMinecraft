[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/cc9a743afb654f488f6cdaca3bcad60c)](https://app.codacy.com/app/EmotionalLove/ReMinecraft?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=EmotionalLove/ReMinecraft&utm_campaign=Badge_Grade_Settings)

A headless Minecraft bouncer written in Java

### Why is it called "RE:Minecraft"?
It's a spin on the anime "RE:Zero"

## About
RE:Minecraft is a headless Minecraft bouncer and bot API, all in one! RE:Minecraft can run multiple plugins at once, and "mirror" the game that its logged into onto an Ip and port of your choice. RE:Minecraft is currently only compatible with Minecraft 1.12.2, but a 1.13.x version will be written soon.
